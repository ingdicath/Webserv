# Setup the configuration file as follow:
#   - / must answer to GET request ONLY
#   - /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice (Not needed in new subject)
#   - any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable (We don't manage regex)
#   - /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
#   - /directory/ must answer to GET request and the root of it would be the repository 
#     YoupiBanane and if no file are requested, it should search for youpi.bad_extension files
